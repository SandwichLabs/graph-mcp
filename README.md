# Agent Memory Graph MCP

Extremely early development 

Don't use this for anything in production, I'm just noodling with MCP here.

The Agent Memory Graph is an advanced memory graph construction tool that allows you to build complex memory structures for agents. It is designed to work with the MCP protocol, enabling efficient memory management and retrieval over large datasets.
